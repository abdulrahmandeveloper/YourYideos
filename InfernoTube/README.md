Love this prompt. Here’s a tight, product-thinking list of **high-leverage features YouTube doesn’t do (or does weakly)** that could make your YouTube-like app feel _excellent_ and different. I grouped them by outcome and gave a crisp “why it matters” + a practical V1 you can ship.

---

# Top differentiators (build-order)

## 1) Viewer control & discovery

- **Algorithm dials** _(Explore vs. Familiar vs. Local vs. Short-form sliders)_
  **Why:** Users feel “trapped” by opaque feeds.
  **V1:** Per-user weights stored in profile; surface toggles on Home; show “why am I seeing this?” with simple signals.

- **Semantic search inside videos** _(search words/concepts across transcripts, jump to the exact moment)_
  **Why:** People come to _find answers_, not watch whole videos.
  **V1:** Auto-transcribe → vector index per video → query -> timestamped jumps; highlight transcript.

- **Collections & workspaces** _(pin, group, and share playlists + notes)_
  **Why:** YouTube playlists are linear and clunky for projects/courses.
  **V1:** Boards with sections, drag-drop videos, public/private, cover image, share link.

- **Advanced filters** _(length, difficulty, production date range, language, region, license, “no clickbait”)_
  **Why:** Power users can’t narrow quickly.
  **V1:** Faceted search + saved searches.

## 2) Learning & productivity features

- **Timecoded notes, highlights, and bookmarks** (personal + shareable)
  **Why:** Learning requires _externalizing_ knowledge.
  **V1:** Side panel with “Add note at 03:12”; export to Markdown.

- **Auto chapters + flashcards + quizzes**
  **Why:** Turn passive viewing into retention.
  **V1:** Chaptering from transcript; generate 5 Q\&As per chapter; spaced-repetition deck export.

- **Multi-caption compare & inline translate**
  **Why:** Language learning & accessibility.
  **V1:** Two‐line subtitle mode (L1/L2) with click-to-define.

## 3) Community that doesn’t suck

- **Threaded discussions per timestamp** _(Reddit-style, not flat)_
  **Why:** YouTube comments collapse context and quality.
  **V1:** Comment tree anchored to time; collapse/expand; quality sort (upvotes + reputation).

- **Co-watch rooms** _(with timeline reactions that persist)_
  **Why:** Shared experiences drive retention & virality.
  **V1:** WebRTC lobby; emoji/event markers saved as a lightweight overlay.

- **Creator Q\&A mode** _(scheduled, timeboxed, threaded)_
  **Why:** Live chats are noisy; static comments are slow.
  **V1:** Host opens Q\&A window; questions upvoted; host answers become pinned, chaptered entries.

## 4) Creation & collaboration

- **Collaborative edits & versioning** _(title/desc/chapters/thumbnail history with diffs)_
  **Why:** Teams iterate; YT hides evolution.
  **V1:** Metadata versions with compare/rollback; changelog.

- **Multi-angle & multi-track playback** _(viewer switches angles or languages)_
  **Why:** Events, music, tutorials benefit from angles/tracks.
  **V1:** Upload multiple sources; UI toggle; sync by timecode.

- **Built-in B-roll & music clearance assistant**
  **Why:** Copyright is a production bottleneck.
  **V1:** Licensed asset library + auto-attribution + “safe/unsafe” detector on upload.

## 5) Monetization that feels fair

- **Revenue mix controls** _(ads, tips, memberships, pay-per-chapter, course bundles)_
  **Why:** One size ≠ all.
  **V1:** Toggle per video/collection; clean paywall at chapter or collection level.

- **Transparent revenue & attribution**
  **Why:** Creators need trust.
  **V1:** Per-video RPM, retention-weighted attribution, referral tracking.

- **Native affiliate blocks** _(timecoded product cards)_
  **Why:** Description links are clumsy.
  **V1:** Structured “Product” block with disclosure; analytics.

## 6) Analytics that drive action

- **Outcome analytics** _(“viewers solved/finished/converted”) not just CTR/retention_
  **Why:** Aligns content with user goals.
  **V1:** Lightweight “Did this help?” prompt at end; funnel to “copied code / downloaded file / completed quiz”.

- **Experimentation beyond thumbnails**
  **Why:** YT experiments are limited and opaque.
  **V1:** Creator-defined A/B on title + chaptering + first 30s hook; automatic winner selection.

## 7) Wellbeing, privacy, and control

- **Focus mode** _(hide recommendations, show transcript + notes only)_
  **Why:** Reduce distraction for learning.
  **V1:** Toggle per video; remember per collection.

- **Privacy presets** _(invite-only, link-with-email, domain-restricted)_
  **Why:** Teams/classes need scoped sharing.
  **V1:** Access rules + signed links; audit log.

- **Data portability**
  **Why:** Trust.
  **V1:** Export notes, collections, watch history, and transcripts as JSON/Markdown.

## Quick build blueprint (practical V1 stack)

- **Transcripts & search:** server job (Whisper/open ASR) → store segments `{text,start,end}`; build vector index (e.g., sentence embeddings) → API `search?q` returns `(videoId, start)`.
- **Timecoded notes:** table `notes(userId, videoId, t, text, visibility)`; optimistic UI; Markdown export.
- **Chapters & quizzes:** autosuggest chapters from transcript silences + keyword density; generate questions → let creator edit; store as structured JSON.
- **Threaded comments:** adjacency list or nested-set; key includes `timestampBucket = floor(seconds/5)` for quick anchor clusters.
- **Co-watch:** simple WebRTC + shared playback state via WebSocket channel `{videoId, t, state}`; store emoji events sparsely.
- **Experiments:** feature flag per asset; randomize on first impression; evaluate on “goal” events.

## Low-effort, high-delight polish

- **Hover scrub with live transcript preview** (show the exact line at that second)
- **Keyboard palette** (`Cmd/Ctrl+K` to jump to chapter/note/video)
- **“Continue learning” lane** (resume across collections with % complete)
- **“Explain this part”** (instant summary of the last 20 seconds)
- **Offline kits** (pre-download transcripts + thumbnails + low-res segments)

---

## What to **not** copy from YouTube

- Over-opaque recommendation loops → replace with **transparent, controllable** feed.
- Flat comments → ship **threaded, timestamped, ranked** discussion.
- One-dimensional monetization → ship **modular** revenue options from day one.
- “Video only” mindset → treat it as a **knowledge object** (video + transcript + notes + quiz + references).

If you want, tell me your _target users_ (e.g., study, dev tutorials, gaming, music), and I’ll turn this into a **feature roadmap** with milestones, DB schema snippets, and React component breakdowns tailored to your Vite setup.
